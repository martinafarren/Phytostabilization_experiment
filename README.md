# Phytostabilization_experiment
Here we attached four R codes used for analysis and presentation of microbime data, the results of which are presented in publication "Compost, plants and endophytes versus metal contamination: Choice of a restoration strategy steers the microbiome in polymetallic mine waste"

## Permanova_pairwisePermanova_Deseq_AbundancePlot
This code shows 
i) PERMANOVA,
ii) pairwise PERMANOVA analysis, 
iii) Differential expression analysis (DESeq2), and 
iv) code for the plot of Relative abundance of bacterial (a) and fungal (b) phyla.

As an example, the code was run for the samples of tailings. However, the same code was used for the analysis also of compost and root samples.

## Shannon_index_Plots_Statistic
This code shows how the diversity index was calculated, ploted, and how the statistical tests were run (pairwise wilcoxon test).

# Phytostabilization Experiment

This repository contains four R scripts used for the analysis and presentation of microbiome data, as described in the publication titled "Compost, Plants, and Endophytes versus Metal Contamination: Choice of a Restoration Strategy Steers the Microbiome in Polymetallic Mine Waste."

## Permanova_pairwisePermanova_Deseq_AbundancePlot

This script includes the following analyses:
- PERMANOVA
- Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis
- Differential expression analysis using DESeq2
- Code for plotting the relative abundance of bacterial (a) and fungal (b) phyla.

The code was initially run for tailings samples but was also used for the analysis of compost and root samples.
