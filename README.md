# Phytostabilization Experiment

This repository contains five R scripts used for the analysis and presentation of microbiome data, as described in the publication titled "Compost, Plants, and Endophytes versus Metal Contamination: Choice of a Restoration Strategy Steers the Microbiome in Polymetallic Mine Waste."

## Permanova_pairwisePermanova_Deseq_AbundancePlot

This script includes the following analyses:
- PERMANOVA
- Pairwise PERMANOVA analysis
- Differential expression analysis using DESeq2
- Code for plotting the relative abundance of bacterial (a) and fungal (b) phyla.

The code was initially run for tailings samples but was also used for the analysis of compost and root samples.
